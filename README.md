# About Me

### Born in Venezuela - Raised Big in Texas - Building in Maryland

Hello! My name is Domingo Salerno, and I am striving to become a data scientist. I graduated from the Univeristy of Texas at Austin in 2018 having studied political science, with my focuses being electoral processes and international politics. Since then, I have worked in the insurance and automotive industries in positions that demanded excellent teamwork, constant organization, and clear communication with management and clients. My work experience has provided me with the investigative, organizational, and time management skills that have prepared me for any challenge that I may face.

In the Spring of 2020, my innate curiousity led me down the rabbit hole that is the world of data. I felt compelled to learn more, and I started taking courses online almost immediately after discovering my fascination with data. I took R courses that covered data manipulation with dplyr, creating visualizations with ggplot2, formatting and reporting using markdown, writing functions, and performing statistical regression analysis. I also taught myself Python, taking courses on data manipulation with pandas, data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn, error-handling. I also wrote functions, iterators, list comprehensions, and generators.

Lately, I have been volunteering at Penns State University on a variety of linguistic research projects. I've included samples of my contributions in the _PennState_ repository on my page. I am also applying to graduate schools with the intent of studying data science and learning the tools I will need to build the career of my dreams. I want to utilize the power of data and collaborate with leaders of this field to drive innovative solutions and insights that will revolutionize our understanding of electoral campaigns and strategies.

When I am not studying or working, you will most likely find me playing guitar, watching sports, and playing computer games! There are few things that bring me so much joy as playing a song I love and really getting into a groove. One of my favorite things about music is thinking about how the individual instruments interact with and compliment each other. Another is how each individual musician has their own touch and brings something to the table that only they can provide. While music speaks to the creative in me, sports and computer games speak to the nerd in me. I love thinking about how games work, how strategies and tactics are developed with certain goals in mind, and how you need to be always be adaptable to changing circumstances. These are just a few of the things that make me who I am!
